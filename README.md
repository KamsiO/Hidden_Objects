# Hidden_Objects
# Kamsi Oramasionwu

This is a Hidden Objects type game created using Python mode for Processing 3. In a hidden objects game, words are
listed that correspond to images that are hidden in a picture. The user has to find the images and click them all 
in a set amount of time without clicking the background more than twice.

To run my program, you need to have Processing 3 or higher installed. Open up Hidden_Objects.pyde and press the
run button in Processing. If the font is big and blocky and not in cursive, please
open up Sweet Hipster.ttf and install the font.

Enjoy!

Note: I don't own any of the artwork included in the game.
